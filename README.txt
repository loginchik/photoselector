photoselector is a pretty simple code, which can compare two folders and move/copy intersection into another one. 
It was created for photographers to ease the process of photo sorting in case jpegs are sorted while NEFs are not.

Code is based on built-in modules os, shutil and datetime (used once for filename generation).
All the user needs is to know how to copy a path to folder. And python IDE.
